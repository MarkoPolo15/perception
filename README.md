This guide provides detailed steps to set up and run Selenium tests using Python. It covers environment setup, dependencies installation, and executing the tests.

Prerequisites:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Ensure pip (Python package installer) is installed.

Step 1: Clone the Repository:
1. If your project is in a repository, clone it using the appropriate command.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment:
1. Create a virtual environment for managing dependencies.
2. Activate the virtual environment.

Step 3: Install Dependencies:
1. Install the required dependencies using pip install requirements.txt file.


Step 4: Project Structure:
project_root/
│
├── configs/
│ └── environment.py
│
├── src/
│ ├── pages/
│ │ ├── home_page.py
│ │ └── login.py
│ └── utilities/
│ └── credentials.py
│
├── tests/
│ ├── test_search_results.py
│ └── conftest.py
│
├── requirements.txt
└── pytest.ini


Step 5: Running the Tests:
1. To run the tests using pytest, navigate to the project directory.
2. Execute the pytest command.
3. Ensure the web browser is not already running, as the test will open a new browser window.

Notes:
1. The login process is handled once per session using fixtures to improve efficiency.
2. The tests include navigating to the home page, performing searches, and verifying various elements on the page.
3. Logging is used for better debugging and tracking of test progress and results.
